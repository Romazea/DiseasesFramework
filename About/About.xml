    <description>
    A framework for RimWorld modders. It allows you to create complex diseases, custom methods of contagion, mutations, and specific cures using only XML files.
    
    For Modders
    
    Check the wiki on GitHub for documentation and examples of XML tags you can use in your own mods.
    
    For Players:
    
    This mod does not add diseases on its own. It is a requirement (dependency) for other mods that use this code. Please place it as high as possible in your load order.
